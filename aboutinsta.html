		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<img src="insta logo.jpg" alt="Your company logo">
		<p>Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos, follow other users, and interact with content through likes, comments, and direct messages. It was launched in 2010 and was later acquired by Facebook in 2012.</p>
		<p>Instagram's focus on visual content and its user-friendly interface has made it one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. As of September 2021, the platform has over 1.2 billion monthly active users worldwide. In addition to sharing photos and videos, users can also post short-form videos through Instagram's "Reels" feature, and share ephemeral content through the platform's "Stories" feature. <br> Instagram has also become a significant platform for influencer marketing, with businesses using the platform to reach new audiences and promote their products or services through partnerships with popular Instagram users. The platform has faced criticism for its impact on mental health, particularly among young people, and its role in perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards.</p>
